Platform: Linux

History
=======
I once wrote this in two days for a job interview.  I didn't take the job, but
I feel this might be a good start for someone.  As it was sitting on my disk,
picking up dust, I decided to release it.

Advantages
==========
* Event-driven, poll()-based

Limitations
===========
* Only GET method
* *NO ACCESS CONTROL*
* No keep-alive
* Files are all opened with mmap
* No URL decoding
* No content-negotiation
* 3 built-in mime-types (HTML, plain text, octet-stream) with a simple
heuristic for discriminating.

Compilation
===========
1) make
2) ./hhttppss -p port -D /path/to/webroot
3) URLs are of the form http://127.0.0.1:8000/file which will cause the file
   /path/to/webroot/file to be served.  Any slashes in "file" will be replaced
   by underscores.
